      <description>The energies of a Compton scatter chain are correlated through the Compton scattering equation as well as the Klein-Nishina distribution. This means that some vital statistics must exist, and perhaps be possible to calculate in closed expression. In this post I wanted to give it a try and compare it to some simulated data.
I recently got a hold on some simulated list-mode data of photons interacting with a silicon volume.</description>

      <description>The List-Mode Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (LM-MLEM) algorithm is widely used in Compton camera reconstruction. It&amp;rsquo;s well suited for the list-mode data architecture and easy to parallelize. This post will be somewhat technical and a sort of summary of the main arguments found in the litterature.
The problem has been stated many times, Ref.[1-8]. I will state it as follows (I will use the same notation as in Ref.[8]), and the proof of it will be the subject of a future post:</description>

      <description>Delving into the practicalities of the inverse problem of reconstructing Compton camera images will lead you to Legandre polynomials or Maximum Likelihood methods, most likely.
Since last week I have been interested in both the analytical reconstruction techniques as well as some of the iterative methods.
Regarding iterative methods, what I found is that it is difficult to get a feeling on how the iterative methods properly work simply because the algorithms (I write mine in Python) is increadibly slow.</description>
