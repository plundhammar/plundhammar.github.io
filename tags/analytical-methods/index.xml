      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The energies of a Compton scatter chain are correlated through the Compton scattering equation as well as the Klein-Nishina distribution. This means that some vital statistics must exist, and perhaps be possible to calculate in closed expression. In this post I wanted to give it a try and compare it to some simulated data.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently got a hold on some simulated list-mode data of photons interacting with a silicon volume. That is, a list

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The List-Mode Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (LM-MLEM) algorithm is widely used in Compton camera reconstruction. It&amp;rsquo;s well suited for the list-mode data architecture and easy to parallelize. This post will be somewhat technical and a sort of summary of the main arguments found in the litterature.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem has been stated many times, Ref.[1-8]. I will state it as follows (I will use the same notation as in Ref.[8]), and the proof of it will be the subject of a future post:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delving into the practicalities of the inverse problem of reconstructing Compton camera images will lead you to Legandre polynomials or Maximum Likelihood methods, most likely.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since last week I have been interested in both the analytical reconstruction techniques as well as some of the iterative methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding iterative methods, what I found is that it is difficult to get a feeling on how the iterative methods properly work simply because the algorithms (I write mine in Python) is increadibly slow. However, I have made some progress and have been able to reproduce some results but in a very corse voxel space. One way of simplifying things is to simplify the system matrix. I was reading Ref. [1] where they sort of reduce the forward problem to the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
