      <description>Delving into the practicalities of the inverse problem of reconstructing Compton camera images will lead you to Legandre polynomials or Maximum Likelihood methods, most likely.
Since last week I have been interested in both the analytical reconstruction techniques as well as some of the iterative methods.
Regarding iterative methods, what I found is that it is difficult to get a feeling on how the iterative methods properly work simply because the algorithms (I write mine in Python) is incredibly slow.</description>

      <description>One of the first properties encountered in Compton camera image reconstruction is the cone-surface projection. Understandig the properties of this geometrical object will set the ground works for understanding more advanced models.
I was reading some articles of the early versions of the Compton camera image reconstruction procedure when I came across Ref.[1] talking about the cone-surface projections. They investigated a primitive version of a &amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;Compton camera&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;. Well, it kind of had some properties like a Compton camera like a scatterer and an absorber but they assumed that photons only scatter at a fixed given angle.</description>
