      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delving into the practicalities of the inverse problem of reconstructing Compton camera images will lead you to Legandre polynomials or Maximum Likelihood methods, most likely.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since last week I have been interested in both the analytical reconstruction techniques as well as some of the iterative methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding iterative methods, what I found is that it is difficult to get a feeling on how the iterative methods properly work simply because the algorithms (I write mine in Python) is increadibly slow. However, I have made some progress and have been able to reproduce some results but in a very corse voxel space. One way of simplifying things is to simplify the system matrix. I was reading Ref. [1] where they sort of reduce the forward problem to the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
